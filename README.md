# chat-server

A simple chat-server written to test the performance of clojure using aleph,lamina and gloss. But it looks like, due to my ignorance,
it is delivering no-where near it's maximum capacity

## How to build

lein uberjar

## How to test

### start the server 
    $ java -jar target/chat-server-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar 
    This starts a chat-server which listens on port 5000
### in a different screen run the testing code written in golang via the following shell-script (you will need golang installed )
    # this opens a number of connections and sends messages to the server running on port 5000
    ./test-chat-server
